# inheritance is a way for a class to obitain all method from another class.

# inheritance avoids duplicate code across multiple classes.

# the class that inherited from is called the superclass or parent class .

# the class that inherits is called the subclass or child class.

# Ruby only supports single inheritance. A class can only inherit from one other class.

# The subclass is a type of the superclass. This is called an "is_a" relationship.

# The relationship does not apply in reverse.

# Thus, the subclass can be called a subset of the superclass.

# A car is a Vehicle but a Vehicle is not guaranteed to be a Car.

# Subclasses are followed by a < symbol and the name of the superclass
